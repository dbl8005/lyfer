### Areas for Improvement

1. **Code Organization and Modularity**:
   - The router.dart file is large and contains both route definitions and logic for fetching data. Consider separating route definitions and data-fetching logic into different files or classes for better maintainability.
   - Break down large widgets into smaller, reusable components (e.g., `HabitDetails` and `EditHabitScreen` could benefit from modularization).

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Improve error messages for users. For example, instead of "Habit not found," provide actionable feedback like "The habit you're looking for doesn't exist. Please try again."
   - Add logging for errors to help with debugging in production.

3. **State Management**:
   - While `Riverpod` is used effectively, some providers (e.g., `habitsRepositoryProvider`) could benefit from better abstraction to reduce coupling between UI and business logic.

4. **UI/UX Enhancements**:
   - Add loading skeletons or shimmer effects for better user experience during data fetching.
   - Improve the design of error and empty states (e.g., add illustrations or call-to-action buttons).

5. **Testing**:
   - Add unit tests for providers, repositories, and utility functions.
   - Add widget tests for critical screens like `HabitDetails` and `EditHabitScreen`.
   - Add integration tests for navigation and user flows.

6. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize the `FutureBuilder` usage by caching data where possible to avoid redundant network calls.
   - Use `const` constructors wherever possible to reduce widget rebuilds.

7. **Accessibility**:
   - Add semantic labels and accessibility features to all widgets (e.g., `CircularProgressIndicator` and `Text` widgets).
   - Ensure color contrast meets accessibility standards.

8. **Documentation**:
   - Add more comments and documentation for public methods, classes, and widgets.
   - Create a README.md with detailed instructions for contributors and developers.
